## Project Description

This portfolio webpage was created for the second homework assignment for the web development bookcamp. I struggled to get the elements exactly right, but managed to get pretty close. With more time I may have been able to achieve a better result. Although with the lessons I learned from this exercise it might be better to just start from scratch.

Towards the end I rushed to include everything I need to fulfill the Acceptance criteria.
